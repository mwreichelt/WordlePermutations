# Wordle Permutation Helper
This is for people who like to play Wordle but often get frustrated sitting around looking at their remaining letters and feeling overwhelmed because they can't think of a word.
In the past I would grab some scrap paper, open a spreadsheet or just get real acquainted with Wordle's backspace button before my brain would go "Oh yeah, no, that series of letters in that spacing could be this word!"

## How to use this program
- The easiest thing to do here is type in the five big boxes at the top of the application! You can type letters to put a letter in a box, at which point the focus moves to the next textbox in the application. If you type backspace in one of the big boxes, you will clear that box and the focus will be put on the previous text box. You can press the spacebar to skip to the next textbox if you do not know what letter to put there. You can also use the tab or shift+tab keyboard commands to move between these boxes.
> Note: Some Wordle Purists may consider the program functions after this point "Cheating". I don't think this is a valid complaint since the next two techniques are doable by anyone with some scrap paper and a pencil but you need to live your best life.
- If you've filled out the five big boxes with the letters you're certain of then you can fill out the "Yellow Letters" and "Remaining Letters" boxes next to give the program a list of letters to make permutations with. If you had the unused letters of "asdfghjkl" for example you could type them in just like that and the program will accept them and use them to generate permutations on the words in the five big boxes.
- Once you've filled out these additional textboxes click the "Generate Permutations" button. This will unlock the "Show Next Permutation" and "Show All Permutations" buttons as well as the "Cheat" and "Cheat A Lot" buttons.
- Clicking "Show Next Permutation" will display the generated permutations one at a time in the five big boxes. If you don't want a giant list of suggestions facing you down, then please feel free to use this button to examine them one at a time.
- Clicking "Show All Permutations" will display all generated permutations at once in an alphabetical list in a new window.
> Note: The program functions described after this point are definitely cheating. But again, you need to live your own life.
- If you click the "Cheat" button the program will show you a list of all the generated permutations that were on the original Wordle's valid word list (list retrieved 2/7/22 from cfreshman).
- If you click the "Cheat A Lot" button the program will show you a list of all the generated permutations that were on the original Wordle's secret word list (list retrieved 2/7/22 from cfreshman).
